```ts
const e = spawn<[Vector3]>([new Vector3()]);
print(has<Vector3>(e));

start({}, () => {
	if (useThrottle(5)) {
		for (const [entity, vec3, cf] of query<[Vector3, CFrame]>()) {
			print(entity, vec3, cf);
		}
	}
});

for (const [e, vec] of query<[Vector3, Without<[CFrame]>]>()) {
	print(e, vec);
}

// Example of using pairs
interface Likes {}
interface Eats {}
interface Apple {}

const alice = spawn();
const bob = spawn();
const charlie = spawn();

registry.add(alice, pair<Likes>(bob));
registry.add(alice, pair<Likes>(charlie));

// The type of a pair is determined by its first component in the relationship.
// In this case, 'Eats' is defined as an empty interface {}.
// An empty interface is a structural type that matches any object.
// This allows us to set Pair<Eats, Apple> to 3, though it's not recommended
// as it effectively becomes an 'any' type, losing type safety.
set<Pair<Eats, Apple>>(bob, 3);

for (const [e] of query().pair<Likes>(bob)) {
	const liked = target<Likes>(e);
	print(`${e} likes ${liked}`);
}

for (const [e, amount] of query<[Pair<Eats, Apple>]>()) {
	const eatsTarget = target<Eats>(e);
	print(`${e} eats ${amount} ${eatsTarget}`);
}

// Using Pair<P> to match any target (wildcard)
// equivelant to Pair<Likes, Wildcard>
for (const [e] of query<[Pair<Likes>]>()) {
	const likedTarget = target<Likes>(e);
	print(`${e} likes ${likedTarget}`);
}
